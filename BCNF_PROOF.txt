Proof:
coupon_category_id is the primary key and the only determinant. Hence, the table is in BCNF.

3. Table: Coupon
Primary Key: coupon_id
FDs:
coupon_id → account_id, coupon_category_id, amount, validity, issued_at, redeemed_at
Proof:
The determinant is a primary key. Thus, the table is in BCNF.

4. Table: Event
Primary Key: event_id
FDs:

Proof:
event_id is the primary key. All dependencies use it as LHS. So, the table is in BCNF.

5. Table: Movie_Event
Primary Key: event_id
FDs:
event_id → imdb_rating, release_date
Proof:
event_id is both the primary key and foreign key, and is a superkey. So, the table is in BCNF.

6. Table: Show_Event
Primary Key: event_id
FDs:
event_id → audience_interaction
Proof:
event_id is the key and only determinant. Hence, BCNF is satisfied.

7. Table: Artist
Primary Key: artist_id
FDs:
artist_id → artist_name
Proof:
Determinant is the primary key. Table is in BCNF.

Primary Key: pincode
FDs:
pincode → city, state, area
Proof:
Primary key determines all attributes. Table is in BCNF.

10. Table: Venue
Primary Key: venue_id
FDs:
venue_id → venue_name, pincode
Proof:
venue_id is the primary key and determinant. So, BCNF is satisfied.

11. Table: Room
Primary Key: room_id
FDs:
room_id → venue_id, room_no, screen_type, capacity
Proof:
All attributes depend on primary key. Hence, BCNF holds.

12. Table: Category
Primary Key: catagory
FDs:
No non-trivial FDs
Proof:
Only one attribute (primary key). Trivially in BCNF.

13. Table: Seat
Primary Key: (room_id, seat_number)
FDs:
(room_id, seat_number) → seat_row, catagory
Proof:
Composite key is a superkey. Hence, BCNF is satisfied.

14. Table: Event_Schedule
Primary Key: schedule_id
FDs:
schedule_id → event_id, manager_id, room_id, event_datetime, sponsored_money
Proof:
schedule_id is the primary key. Table is in BCNF.

15. Table: Notification
Primary Key: notification_id
FDs:
notification_id → schedule_id, message, sent_at
Proof:
Primary key is the determinant. Table is in BCNF.

16. Table: User_Notifications
Primary Key: (account_id, notification_id)
FDs:
No non-trivial FDs
Proof:
Only the key exists; no partial or transitive dependencies. Hence, BCNF.

17. Table: Show_Pricing
Primary Key: (schedule_id, category)
FDs:
(schedule_id, category) → category_capacity, price
Proof:
Composite key is the only determinant. Table is in BCNF.

18. Table: Movie_Pricing
Primary Key: (schedule_id, catagory)
FDs:
(schedule_id, catagory) → price
Proof:
Composite key is the only determinant. Table is in BCNF.

19. Table: Payment_Details
Primary Key: payment_id
FDs:
payment_id → transaction_id, payment_method, payment_status, payment_amount, payment_date
Proof:
All attributes determined by the primary key. Hence, BCNF.

20. Table: Booking
Primary Key: booking_id
FDs:
booking_id → schedule_id, account_id, payment_id, review, booking_time
Proof:
booking_id is the primary key. All attributes are dependent on it. BCNF holds.
